# TUISpeak

This is a sample project to help me learn [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

## Requirements
Ubuntu 22.04+

Packages TBD.  I know it depends on `speech-dispatcher`, `espeak`, and `festival`, but I'm not 100% sure.

## Why?
Sometimes, life throws you curveballs and you lose your voice.

This is for those times.
